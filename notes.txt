Results:

- Not good at D40: too little training data - sees manhole covers, dark oil spills and even dirt on the lense.
- Make graphs of class instances predicted Vs. in training data - does it make sense? Resolution might be a problem!
        - Could not run at higher resolution: too long time :(
        
 - /yolov5/runs/detect/gpu_single_30/Norway_009004.jpg is a nice illustration for the presentation.

 Some succesful runs:
 
     - overnight rungpu_hf_yolo_on.out: yolov5/runs/train/gpu_single_30,
     
         => yolov5/runs/train/gpu_single_30/weights
         
         Running low and high res detections:
         "detection_single_gpu_30_low_res" and "detection_single_gpu_30_high_res"
             - To be found under yolov5/runs/detect
             
          => Submissions created.
              What?? The detection_single_gpu_30_low_res found more D20 than D10! Interesting (Ensemble would be cool).
              
     - Could concider turning up the Recall; from 0.25 -> 0.35 or something
